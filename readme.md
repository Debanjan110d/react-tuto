## Projects in this workspace

Below are the project folders available in this workspace. Click a folder link to open it in your editor or its README/index file for more details.

- [customReact](./customReact/) — small custom React example (open `customReact/index.html`).
- [react_vite](./react_vite/) — Vite + React project (see `react_vite/README.md`).
- [react-vite2](./react-vite2/) — Vite + React sample (see `react-vite2/README.md`).
- [react-vite3](./react-vite3/) — Vite + React with components (see `react-vite3/README.md`).
- [react-vite4_colorChanger](./react-vite4_colorChanger/) — color changer demo (see `react-vite4_colorChanger/README.md`).
- [react-vite5](./react-vite5/) — password generator demo (see `react-vite5/README.md`).

## Quick run (Vite projects)

Most `react-*` folders are Vite projects. To run any of them (example uses `react-vite5`), open a terminal and run:

```powershell
cd react-vite5
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

For simple static demos (like `customReact`), you can open the `index.html` file in a browser or serve the folder with a static server.

## Next steps

- I can add a simple root script to start any demo by name (e.g., `npm run demo -- react-vite5`).
- I can create or update per-project README files with tailored run instructions.

If you want me to add one of those, tell me which option you prefer.
